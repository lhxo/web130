            <h1>Christopher Yip</h1>
            
            <p>Hello. My name is Christopher I am on the web development path at Seattle Central. I am a California native that has moved to Seattle in 2016. I have worked for various restaurants in the city as a line cook / kitchen manager but have been wanting to change careers. I have always been interested in web development and want to produce web sites and applications to help connect communities. I play a bit of board games, Magic, Melee, and Tekken.</p>
